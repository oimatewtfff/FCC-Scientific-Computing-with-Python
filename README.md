# FCC Scientific Computing with Python

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, i've learned Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then i've quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.
All of the assignments I completed passed the tests attached to them, and the wording of the assignments can be found in the README.md files
